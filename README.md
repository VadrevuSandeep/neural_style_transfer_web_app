🎨 Neural Style Transfer Web App

A Streamlit web application for real-time neural style transfer, allowing users to upload a content image and a style image to generate a stylized result—all with a modern UI and no dataset required.

📝 Description

This project uses a pre-trained neural style transfer model from TensorFlow Hub to apply artistic styles from one image to another. Users can upload images directly through a web interface, and the app instantly generates and displays the stylized image. The app features a custom background, intuitive icons, and responsive padding for an enhanced user experience.
